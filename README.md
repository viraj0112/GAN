# GAN
GAN is a Generative AI image enhancement tool that improves blurred and noisy photos by combining SRGAN and DCGAN. 
It is trained on 2300 epochs to assess the effectiveness of these two GANs in producing better output due to resource constraints.

This model is trained in Google Collaboratory and trained on thousands of images. Our team of four members completed this as a college mini-project.
While working on this, we created our own dataset by converting high-resolution images into low-resolution images by adding blurr, noise, compression, distortion, resizing, and artifacts.
